  <p><em>A Lua binding for Dear ImGui with syntax as close as possible to the original C++ API</em></p>
</div>

## Overview

ImGui-Lua is a binding library that ports Dear ImGui functionality to Lua while maintaining syntax that closely mirrors the original C++ API. The lexer has been modified to support the `::` operator, allowing for nearly identical code structure between C++ and Lua implementations.

## Key Features

**Authentic ImGui Experience**: The modified Lua lexer allows you to write ImGui code that looks and feels exactly like C++ ImGui, making it easy to port existing ImGui applications or follow C++ ImGui tutorials.

**Complete Widget Support**: All major ImGui widgets are supported including buttons, text inputs, sliders, combo boxes, tables, tree views, and more.

**Demo Application**: Includes a comprehensive demo showcasing widgets, text input, tables, trees, color pickers, and theming capabilities.

## Documentation

The API matches Dear ImGui's C++ interface exactly:
- Same function names and parameters
- Identical return behavior
- Direct translation from C++ examples
